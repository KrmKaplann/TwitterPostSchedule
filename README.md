For example, imagine you have 10 Twitter accounts and you need to schedule content for each of them. Doing this manually on Twitter would be time-consuming and complicated. Instead, with this Excel-based program, you can manage and develop your content more easily. Thanks to the flexibility of Excel, you can see all your social media content at a glance and make quick edits as needed.

Another advantage of the program is that social media content is securely stored on your computer and easily managed. This way, all the content you produce is stored in an organized manner and can be quickly accessed when needed. 

You can also categorize your content by date, topic and other criteria, allowing you to plan your social media more strategically.

In summary, this program significantly improves the way you plan, manage and optimize your social media content. It provides great convenience for users with multiple accounts and is an indispensable tool for professional social media managers.

## So how to use the program, what is the standard filing style?

In the first step, we need to access the folder of the social media site we will be working on. As you can see in the image below, the folders of the main social media sites such as Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, YouTube, Pinterest and Twitter are located in this section.

In this step, since we plan to focus primarily on Twitter, we log in directly to the Twitter folder. This folder contains all the tools and files to plan and manage Instagram-specific content.

Depending on needs and preferences, necessary revisions can be made to the code. With this flexibility, you can effectively manage and optimize your content on both platforms.

This process helps you organize your social media content more efficiently and develop a cohesive sharing strategy across both platforms.

After logging in to the Twitter folder, you will be presented with Twitter accounts from which you can schedule posts. You can share videos by managing and organizing the content in the folders of these Twitter accounts.

Within the Twitter folder, there are subfolders for various Twitter accounts. Each folder in the image below represents a specific Twitter account. These folders contain Twitter videos that are scheduled to be shared to the respective accounts. Within each account folder, you can find, organize and manage the sharing of content specific to that account.

In each account folder, you can find and manage Twitter videos specific to that account. With this structure, you can organize the content of each account separately and keep track of the sharing process in a more organized way. As seen below, .mp4 format files are uploaded to the folder for planning purposes. All content found here can be shared.

As we approach the final stages, organizing the Excel Sheet is critical to developing an effective sharing strategy. Each Excel Sheet represents an owned Twitter account. This Excel Scheduling file allows for efficient organization of content descriptions, posting dates and times.
